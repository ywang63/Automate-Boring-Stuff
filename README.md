# Automate-Boring-Stuff
This repository includes codes I used to automate boring stuff with Excel.

1. [Installation](#installation)
2. [Project Motivation](#motivation)
3. [File Descriptions](#files)
4. [Results](#results)
5. [Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements](#licensing)


All data are dummy data, created in Excel with random generation formula for privacy concerns. 


## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
2 Excel files as inputs are in the same repository.
No additional installation is needed. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
The project is created by me to save my work hours for repetitive tasks with Excels. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Markdown cells were used to explain my thought process and structure of the project.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
Once the code is finished running, you should expect:
- Mutiple Excel workbooks with each market data split. 
- Each tab represents each dealer. 
- Two additional tabs: a total summary of base data, and a total summary of add-on data.
